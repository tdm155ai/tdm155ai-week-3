  cameras: "This still was captured at the studio-camera station of a class on camera craft. Say how it is framed: shot size, camera angle, where the subject sits in the frame (thirds, center, look room), depth of field, and whether the subject is looking into the lens or off it.",
  obscura: "This still was captured at the camera-obscura station of a class on camera craft. It is probably a picture of a projected image: a lens throwing an image onto frosted acrylic or ground glass, a projector, or a camera pointed at its own monitor. Say what the image shows and what the apparatus added: inversion, vignetting, a hot spot, texture, blur, color casts, or recursion.",
